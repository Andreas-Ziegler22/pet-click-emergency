# pet-click-emergency

Pet emergency app

This will be a project that will build with love and respect

I will build slowly

History:

Anush is a father of the dog LOKI. LOKI was a Labrador and the best one....

Sadly LOKI died on my hands when we where playing with a small ball  
The ball stuck in the throat...Loki passed away
it was a really sad day 28.03.2022.

it was a hell situation the phone number that i called didn't work at all and I lost precious time
that time costed a life.

I wish Loki could forgive me.

That day will die with me but before it happens I want to save many life as possible.

My idea is to develop a app that will save pets and animals.

I wish that all places related with animals will have my app on it.

I know until here are too much bla-bla-bla but wha is behind of all is so painful and still hard to put out.

The main Idea is to click button app
witch finds your geo-location and try to call the nearest vet emergency number.
this will be the version 0

Will be hard project because is not only a frontend but the main engine will be backend

"A IDEA written down becomes a GOAL
A GOAL broken down into steps become a PLAN
A PLAN backed by ACTION becomes REALTY"

I found this one and I love it If I knew who wrote I would add the name for sure.

All contributions are welcome.
